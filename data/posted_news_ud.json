Mike Fry, infrastructure data & security solutions director at Logicalis UK&I, says the lack of security resources is a major obstacle. Deploying MXDR to cover off the entire IT ecosystem is key to peace of mind and improving overall protection. MXDR hopes to be a solution to the problem of cybersecurity professionals hearing too many cries of ‘wolf!’ and being overwhelmed by information overload. It can be seen as 'just another tool' in a toolbox that’s already overwhelming an under-resourced IT department.",

        "summary": "A formal global body can scale prevention, investigation and disruption of cybercrime effectively. Shared legal definitions, harmonizing extradition laws and tackling digital poverty are essential foundations for an enforcement framework. Cybercrime is the one area in cybersecurity where global consensus is achievable, as most nations separate it from national security interests. Unlike cyberwarfare and nation-state attacks, which often trigger debates about national security, sovereignty and how to attribute responsibility, cybercrime offers a more clear-cut path to international cooperation.",

The event was hosted by the Center for the National Interest in partnership with George Mason University’s National Security Institute. The panelists discussed how the threat environment has changed, including the increasing role of generative AI, the challenges of attribution, and the sobering fact that many attacks go undetected for months, if not years. The discussion left the audience questioning, who is ultimately responsible when infrastructure fails: Is it the private sector's duty to defend itself, or must the federal government step in more forcefully?",

Ransomware attacks have become so widespread that 72% of all businesses were impacted by ransomware in 2023 alone. Unlike other types of outages, ransomware recovery presents several unique challenges and risks. It’s often not readily obvious which systems or data were impacted. Attackers may have compromised some servers or databases but not others. The environment that was compromised during a ransomware attack must remain unchanged while researchers analyze it to ensure that they mitigate the root cause.",

Adversaries included DPRK IT workers posing as job applicants, ransomware operators probing for ways to access/abuse our platform, and Chinese state-sponsored actors targeting organizations aligned with our business and customer base. This report highlights a rarely-discussed but crucially important attack surface: security vendors themselves. When adversaries compromise a security company, they don’t just breach a single environment—they potentially gain insight into how thousands of environments and millions of endpoints are protected.",

Invoice fraud is also on the rise at the same time as these new scams are emerging. Members need to be alert as fraudsters use AI more often to generate these invoices, receipts, communications, and even payment confirmations. There are tools in development to counter this rising threat, but it remains unclear how effective they will be at detecting these false claims in isolation.",

Power cut halted transport services, shut down sections of industry, and left homes and public infrastructure without power for much of the afternoon. Energy authorities later confirmed that the outage originated from a sudden, sharp drop in electricity supply that destabilised the grid connection between Spain and France. Investigations are ongoing, but early reports suggest the instability may have been linked to atmospheric conditions that impacted transmission infrastructure, rather than deliberate interference or structural failure.",

        "summary": "Two pro-Russian cyber “hacktivist” groups, Dark Storm Team and NoName057, have claimed responsibility for the major power outage that hit Spain and Portugal on Monday. Spain’s National Cybersecurity Office has previously denied any cyber attack behind the electricity outage in Spain. If it is proven that the blackout was directly caused by the cyberattack, it could be one of the biggest attacks on civilian sites in Europe. The expression “cutting off the electricity in some NATO countries” could mean that, if proven, the attack could be part of a larger vision targeting NATO countries.",

The WEF noted in its January Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2025 report that ‘modern technology relies heavily on substantial energy consumption, rendering power grids highly attractive targets for cybercriminals’ It added that the global transition to renewable energy systems is also creating new vulnerabilities.",

It seems likely there may be a link between them, but the extent of the attacks is yet to be seen. Concerns are rising for businesses across the country, and retail attacks have risen sharply since the development of AI tools.",

At its core, ransomware persists not because of technological failures, but because it exploits fundamental economic misalignments between victims, service providers, and authorities. The ransom demands are bigger now and the stakes are higher. According to Coveware’s 2024 Q4 ransomware report, the average ransom payment reached $554,000, with 25% of victims choosing to pay the ransom. These payments have funded increasingly sophisticated criminal operations.",
